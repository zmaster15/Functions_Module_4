## Introduction
This project is the fourth coding module challenge that we had to complete as part of the Denver University AI Bootcamp coursework. 

The initial code provided for the challenge had us work with a CSV file, ingest it and then manipulate the data and perform an analysis on the data. We were also asked to create a fucntion and apply it to only certain columns of the dataframe. The Resource file includes was sales data and we had to find out which clients were the most profitable. 


## Installation Requirements
*Requirements*: You must run Python 3.12.7 to execute the code as the code uses match case sytax that is older versions of python will not recognize.

## Usage
Anyone that would like to understand how to perform an analysis on a CSV by ingesting it into python as a dataframe to easily manipulate it.

## License
I've included the MIT License to encourage collaboration and use by the community.

## Acknowledgement / Contributing
Thank to the guidance of the Denver University AI Bootcamp Teachers Assistant's and their hints via comments that helped me complete this assignment. Without this I would've been completely lost. 

While a section of this code was written by the Denver University AI Bootcamp Teachers Assistant, it has been modified / completed by me.
